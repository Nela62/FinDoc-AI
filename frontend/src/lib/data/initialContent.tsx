The platform gives clients access to features such as data security, IoT, machine learning, automation, blockchain, and data visualization and analysis [9]. AWS’ primary constraint continues to be locating and hiring the top talent in engineering and computer science [7]. Amazon Web Services is also Amazon’s most global service line with locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. Amazon also has plans to expand its AWS network to South Africa [9]. AWS’ global presence makes it the most susceptible to global climate and political risks, as well as foreign exchange risks [1].',

This segment includes all items sold directly by Amazon: the “Fulfilled by Amazon” category, “Amazon Basics”, and purchases of digital content (without a subscription). Online sales also include orders for pickup or delivery made online for any of Amazon’s physical retail locations [1]. Online store sales are the biggest subcategory for Amazon’s revenue, with $122.99 billion in 2018, representing 52.81% of the year’s entire revenue. Online sales have a three-year CAGR of 16.99%, and I forecast that this will tapper to 7% by 2022 due to constrained growth in the ecommerce industry.',

It is not possible to determine a precise revenue CAGR for this category because of its brief history. However, I have forecasted this category’s revenue CAGR to be 22% in 2019 and fall to 19% by 2022. Physical store sales will be a difficult market for Amazon to gain users in [10]. I initially anticipate strong growth (22% CAGR) for this category as many early adopters will rush to use Amazon’s new services. However, I believe that the average consumer will be slow to embrace Amazon for physical retail, and Amazon may find it difficult to compete against heavily entrenched competitors such as Walmart, Target, Costco, and Kroger.',
