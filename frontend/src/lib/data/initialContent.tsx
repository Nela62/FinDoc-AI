          text: "Given these factors, as well as the law of large numbers and Amazon's massive existing sales base, Amazon's overall retail sales growth could lag the industry average in coming years. The slowing in overall business activity and consumer spending is also impacting retail activity worldwide. For FY23 and FY24, as Amazon adapts and adjusts to the post-pandemic period, we expect the company's online retail growth to slow to the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range. We note, however, that Amazon has surprised investors in the past with the strength of its business model.",

Based on our historical comparables analysis, peer indicated value and discounted free cash flow valuation, our blended valuation model is about $210, above current prices and in a now-rising trend after declining.
