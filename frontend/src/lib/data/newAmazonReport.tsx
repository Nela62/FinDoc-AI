(NGS: AMZN) rose 7% in the after-market on 2/1/24 after the giant online retailer and cloud company posted above-consensus revenue and GAAP EPS for 4Q23. Amazon also provided positive current-quarter guidance. Management reiterated its upbeat outlook for both retail operations and AWS. Amazon generated record cash flow from operations for 2023.</p><p>During the holiday quarter of 4Q23, total sales rose 14% annually to $170 billion. North American operations (excluding AWS) posted a new all-time high in operating profit, exceeding the prior peak quarter (3Q23) by over $2 billion. International cut its operating loss significantly year-over-year, while AWS grew its operating profit in mid-double-digit percentages. Amazon's retail sales grew faster than U.S. online retail sales overall during the 2023 holiday period.</p><p>Late in 3Q23, Amazon announced plans to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a leading provider of AI foundation models and an advocate for the responsible deployment of generative AI. AWS remains Amazon's key profit center, and is benefiting from ongoing cloud momentum and global digital transformation. As the leading provider of Infrastructure-as-a-Service and other cloud services, AWS is uniquely positioned in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market, and the Anthropic partnership meaningfully strengthens AWS at a key time in the AI gold rush.</p><p>In retail, the increasing contribution from third-party merchants is lessening Amazon's need to continue investing aggressively in its fulfilment network. And the strong base of Prime customers who prize convenience and free shipping should enable steady growth in Amazon's own retail trends. The shake-out in streaming services could be a further growth driver for Prime, based on its video offerings.</p><p>In contrast with most recent years, AMZN was a market and peer laggard in 2021 and 2022. Even after rising in 2023, AMZN's multi-year lagging performance provides an opportunity to establish or dollar-average into undisputed category leader Amazon. We are reiterating our BUY rating and raising our 12-month target price to $185, from $165.</p><h2 id="0d4760a7-7a8b-41f1-bd9b-e4808c1337f8" data-toc-id="0d4760a7-7a8b-41f1-bd9b-e4808c1337f8">Recent Developments</h2><p>AMZN is up 5% year-to-date in 2024, while immediate peers are up 1%. AMZN rose 81% in 2023, while the peer group of Argus-covered internet, social media &amp; cloud company stocks advanced 70%. AMZN fell 50% in 2022, while immediate peers dropped 43%; inched up 2% in 2021, while peers rose 21%; and advanced 76% in 2020, while peers surged 89%.</p><p>For 4Q23, Amazon posted revenue of $169.9 billion, which was up 14% from $149.2 billion a year earlier; sales were also up 19% sequentially. Revenue exceeded the high end of management's $160-$167 billion guidance range and beat the $166.2 billion consensus estimate by more than $3 billion. Amazon posted GAAP EPS of $1.00 per diluted share for 4Q23, compared with $0.03 a year earlier. The consensus GAAP EPS estimate was $0.80. Amazon does not guide on EPS. At the sales and operating profit guidance midpoints, Argus had modeled EPS in the $0.75-$0.85 range.</p><p>Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO who has had an embattled first few years on the job, noted that 4Q23 was a record-breaking holiday quarter for Amazon and closed out a 'robust' 2023 in which sales rose in double-digits and GAAP EPS rebounded sharply from a loss in 2022. The company generated record cash flow from operations of $85 billion, nearly doubling the 2022 tally.</p><p>For 4Q23, total product and services sales excluding AWS were $145.7 billion, up 14% annually and 21% sequentially. The total product and services (ex AWS) operating profit was $6.04 billion, compared with an operating loss of $2.47 billion a year earlier in 4Q22. Product and services operating margin for all operations excluding AWS was 4.1% for 4Q23, improved from 3.7% in 3Q23 and negative 1.9% a year earlier.</p><p>North American retail revenue of $105.5 billion (62% of total revenue) was up 13% year-over-year. North American (NA) retail generated an all-time record operating profit of $6.5 billion, vs. a year-earlier loss of $240 million. The NA retail operating margin was 6.1% in 4Q23, up 120 bps sequentially from 4.9% in 3Q23 and up from a negative 0.3% a year earlier. North American operations ex AWS posted their highest operating profit ever, exceeding the prior peak in 3Q23 and before that in the pandemic quarter of 1Q21.</p><p>International retail revenue of $40.2 billion (24% of total) increased 17% annually. The International segment margin was negative 1.0% on a loss of $419 million; the international margin was negative 6.5% a year earlier on a $2.3 billion loss. International retail had a stretch of profitability from 2Q20 through 2Q21; prior to that, international was not profitable from 2016 to 2020.</p><p>Digging deeper into the number, Online store sales - representing wholly owned products retailed by Amazon - were $70.5 billion in 4Q23, up 9% from 4Q22; the wholly owned retail category had been negative or flat year-over-year in four of the past seven quarters. As Amazon continues to diversify its revenue streams, online stores represented 42% of 4Q23 revenue, down from 43% a year earlier and more than 50% in 2020.</p><p>Within retail, the best growth continues to come from third-party merchants. Sales from this category of $43.6 billion (26% of total revenue) grew 20% year-over-year. Sales at physical stores (3% of total) were up 4% year-over-year in 4Q23, as Whole Foods stores and Amazon retail stores generated more foot traffic. This formerly slow-growing category is seeing an upward trend; Amazon is also directing some Prime returns to Whole Foods sites.</p><p>Amazon is first and foremost a retailer, and total goods retail revenue (online stores, physical stores, and third-party merchants) grew 13% in 4Q23; that was up from 4% growth for all of 2022. This category represented 70% of revenue in 4Q23, vs. 71% a year earlier.</p><p>For the holiday quarter of 4Q23, Amazon stacked up well against the U.S. competition. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), U.S. holiday sales grew by 3.8% from 2022 levels. During the holiday period, which includes the combined months of November and December though not October, sales of $964 billion were just shy of the $1 trillion mark. The 3.8% growth in 2023 holiday spending is about in line with the 4% average for the past 20 years. The pandemic of course distorted that average, with 14% growth in 2021 and 5% growth in 2022.</p><p>Within retail, the best growth continues to come from third-party merchants. Sales from this category of $32.3 billion (24% of total revenue) grew 18% year-over-year. Sales at physical stores (4% of total) were up 18% year-over-year in 2Q23, as Whole Foods stores and Amazon retail stores generated more foot traffic. This formerly slow-growing category is seeing an upward shift as consumers become accustomed to their kitchens once again; Amazon is also directing some Prime returns to Whole Foods sites.

export const newAmazonReportMarkdown = `## Business Description\n

Amazon.com is the leading U.S. e-commerce retailer and among the top e-commerce sites globally. Amazon.com also provides Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the global leader in cloud-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platforms. The company's Prime membership platform is a key online retail differentiator, providing customers with free shipping (after an annual fee) along with exclusive media content (music, video, audible books, etc.). The company's Kindle reader and Alexa-based Echo and Dot digital voice assistants are category leaders.\n

## Recommendation: Buy

- Holiday quarter strength, positive outlook

- Amazon reported above-consensus revenue and EPS for 4Q23 and provided positive guidance for 1Q24\. Amazon exceeded the high end of its operating profit expectations on volume, cost controls, and mix.

- Despite/reflecting global macro-economic softness and a weaker environment for consumer online retail, Amazon's revenue topped consensus by over $3 billion, while GAAP profits beat Street expectations by about 20%.

- The AWS business, which had shown signs of deceleration, appears to have been energized by the global push to generative AI.

- Amazon appears to have retained market-share gains that it built during the pandemic. We believe that AMZN warrants long-term accumulation in most equity accounts.

## Investment Thesis

BUY-rated Amazon.com Inc. (NGS: AMZN) rose 7% in the after-market on 2/1/24 after the giant online retailer and cloud company posted above-consensus revenue and GAAP EPS for 4Q23\. Amazon also provided positive current-quarter guidance. Management reiterated its upbeat outlook for both retail operations and AWS. Amazon generated record cash flow from operations for 2023.

During the holiday quarter of 4Q23, total sales rose 14% annually to $170 billion. North American operations (excluding AWS) posted a new all-time high in operating profit, exceeding the prior peak quarter (3Q23) by over $2 billion. International cut its operating loss significantly year-over-year, while AWS grew its operating profit in mid-double-digit percentages. Amazon's retail sales grew faster than U.S. online retail sales overall during the 2023 holiday period.

Late in 3Q23, Amazon announced plans to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a leading provider of AI foundation models and an advocate for the responsible deployment of generative AI. AWS remains Amazon's key profit center, and is benefiting from ongoing cloud momentum and global digital transformation. As the leading provider of Infrastructure-as-a-Service and other cloud services, AWS is uniquely positioned in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market, and the Anthropic partnership meaningfully strengthens AWS at a key time in the AI gold rush.

In retail, the increasing contribution from third-party merchants is lessening Amazon's need to continue investing aggressively in its fulfilment network. And the strong base of Prime customers who prize convenience and free shipping should enable steady growth in Amazon's own retail trends. The shake-out in streaming services could be a further growth driver for Prime, based on its video offerings.

In contrast with most recent years, AMZN was a market and peer laggard in 2021 and 2022\. Even after rising in 2023, AMZN's multi-year lagging performance provides an opportunity to establish or dollar-average into undisputed category leader Amazon. We are reiterating our BUY rating and raising our 12-month target price to $185, from $165.

## Recent Developments

AMZN is up 5% year-to-date in 2024, while immediate peers are up 1%. AMZN rose 81% in 2023, while the peer group of Argus-covered internet, social media & cloud company stocks advanced 70%. AMZN fell 50% in 2022, while immediate peers dropped 43%; inched up 2% in 2021, while peers rose 21%; and advanced 76% in 2020, while peers surged 89%.

For 4Q23, Amazon posted revenue of $169.9 billion, which was up 14% from $149.2 billion a year earlier; sales were also up 19% sequentially. Revenue exceeded the high end of management's $160-$167 billion guidance range and beat the $166.2 billion consensus estimate by more than $3 billion. Amazon posted GAAP EPS of $1.00 per diluted share for 4Q23, compared with $0.03 a year earlier. The consensus GAAP EPS estimate was $0.80\. Amazon does not guide on EPS. At the sales and operating profit guidance midpoints, Argus had modeled EPS in the $0.75-$0.85 range.

Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO who has had an embattled first few years on the job, noted that 4Q23 was a record-breaking holiday quarter for Amazon and closed out a 'robust' 2023 in which sales rose in double-digits and GAAP EPS rebounded sharply from a loss in 2022\. The company generated record cash flow from operations of $85 billion, nearly doubling the 2022 tally.

For 4Q23, total product and services sales excluding AWS were $145.7 billion, up 14% annually and 21% sequentially. The total product and services (ex AWS) operating profit was $6.04 billion, compared with an operating loss of $2.47 billion a year earlier in 4Q22\. Product and services operating margin for all operations excluding AWS was 4.1% for 4Q23, improved from 3.7% in 3Q23 and negative 1.9% a year earlier.

North American retail revenue of $105.5 billion (62% of total revenue) was up 13% year-over-year. North American (NA) retail generated an all-time record operating profit of $6.5 billion, vs. a year-earlier loss of $240 million. The NA retail operating margin was 6.1% in 4Q23, up 120 bps sequentially from 4.9% in 3Q23 and up from a negative 0.3% a year earlier. North American operations ex AWS posted their highest operating profit ever, exceeding the prior peak in 3Q23 and before that in the pandemic quarter of 1Q21.

International retail revenue of $40.2 billion (24% of total) increased 17% annually. The International segment margin was negative 1.0% on a loss of $419 million; the international margin was negative 6.5% a year earlier on a $2.3 billion loss. International retail had a stretch of profitability from 2Q20 through 2Q21; prior to that, international was not profitable from 2016 to 2020.

Digging deeper into the number, Online store sales - representing wholly owned products retailed by Amazon - were $70.5 billion in 4Q23, up 9% from 4Q22; the wholly owned retail category had been negative or flat year-over-year in four of the past seven quarters. As Amazon continues to diversify its revenue streams, online stores represented 42% of 4Q23 revenue, down from 43% a year earlier and more than 50% in 2020.

Within retail, the best growth continues to come from third-party merchants. Sales from this category of $43.6 billion (26% of total revenue) grew 20% year-over-year. Sales at physical stores (3% of total) were up 4% year-over-year in 4Q23, as Whole Foods stores and Amazon retail stores generated more foot traffic. This formerly slow-growing category is seeing an upward trend; Amazon is also directing some Prime returns to Whole Foods sites.

Amazon is first and foremost a retailer, and total goods retail revenue (online stores, physical stores, and third-party merchants) grew 13% in 4Q23; that was up from 4% growth for all of 2022\. This category represented 70% of revenue in 4Q23, vs. 71% a year earlier.

For the holiday quarter of 4Q23, Amazon stacked up well against the U.S. competition. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), U.S. holiday sales grew by 3.8% from 2022 levels. During the holiday period, which includes the combined months of November and December though not October, sales of $964 billion were just shy of the $1 trillion mark. The 3.8% growth in 2023 holiday spending is about in line with the 4% average for the past 20 years. The pandemic of course distorted that average, with 14% growth in 2021 and 5% growth in 2022.

Within retail, the best growth continues to come from third-party merchants. Sales from this category of $32.3 billion (24% of total revenue) grew 18% year-over-year. Sales at physical stores (4% of total) were up 18% year-over-year in 2Q23, as Whole Foods stores and Amazon retail stores generated more foot traffic. This formerly slow-growing category is seeing an upward shift as consumers become accustomed to their kitchens once again; Amazon is also directing some Prime returns to Whole Foods sites. Amazon is first and foremost a retailer, and total goods retail revenue (online stores, physical stores, and third-party merchants) grew 9% in 2Q23, up from 4% growth for all of 2022\. This category represented 67% of revenue in 2Q23, vs. 68% a year earlier.

Online and non-store sales growth for the holiday period of 8.2% was better than the 6.5% growth forecast from Argus Economics. Online sales growth in 2023 was against a tough comp, given 9.5% growth in 2022 and 11.3% in 2021\. The online and non-store category (which is 90% online) continues to grow as a percentage of holiday spending, reaching 28% of 2023 holiday sales. By every metric, Amazon's retail sales rose faster than the industry overall.

In most quarters, Amazon's nonretail businesses grow faster than merchandising operations. In 4Q23, non-goods services - including subscription services, AWS, advertising & other - generated revenue of $50.7 billion (30% of total) and grew 17% year-over-year. Subscription services (6% of total) grew 3% annually, while advertising (9% of total) grew 27%.

AWS remains fast growing and high margined. Although sales growth and margin levels have been easing, AWS has regained vigor as AI mania grips the market. For 4Q23, Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue of $24.2 billion (14% of total) rose 13% year-over-year and was up 5% sequentially. AWS operating profit was $7.2 billion, increasing 3% from $5.2 billion a year earlier. AWS operating margin was 29.6% in 4Q23, versus 30.3% in 3Q23 and 24.3% a year earlier.

AWS is now comfortably at a $90 billion-plus revenue annual run rate and approaching annualized revenue of $100 billion. For over a year, cloud customers were 'optimizing' their spending in response to tough economic conditions. Customers have started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment, reflecting urgency to position for the generative AI opportunity in its nascent stage. We believe AWS, which is globally No. 1 in cloud services, is positioned for long-term growth as the era of AI gets underway.

Late in 3Q23, Amazon announced plans to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a leading provider of AI foundation models and an advocate for the responsible deployment of generative AI. Anthropic has selected AWS as its primary cloud provider for mission-critical workloads, and will train and deploy its future foundation models on AWS Trainium and AWS Interfentia chips. It will also provide AWS customers worldwide with access to its foundation models via Amazon Bedrock.

## Earnings and Growth Analysis

For 4Q23, Amazon posted revenue of $169.9 billion, which was up 14% from $149.2 billion a year earlier; sales were also up 19% sequentially. Revenue exceeded the high end of management's $160-$167 billion guidance range and beat the $166.2 billion consensus estimate by more than $3 billion.

The GAAP gross margin tightened to 45.5% in 4Q23 from 47.6% in 3Q23 and expanded from 42.6% a year earlier. The GAAP operating margin was 7.8% in 4Q23, compared to 7.8% in 3Q23 and 1.8% a year earlier.

Amazon posted GAAP EPS of $1.00 per diluted share for 4Q23, compared with $0.03 a year earlier. The consensus GAAP EPS estimate was $0.80\. Amazon does not guide on EPS. At the sales and operating profit guidance midpoints, Argus had modeled EPS in the $0.75-$0.85 range.

For all of 2023, revenue of $574.8 billion rose 12% from $514.0 billion in 2022\. GAAP earnings totaled $2.91 per diluted share for 2023, up from a GAAP loss of $0.27 for 2022.

## Financial Strength and Dividend

Our financial strength rating on Amazon is Medium-High, the second-highest rating on our five-point scale. Amazon has begun a $10 billion share repurchase program and is also finalizing past investments in operating infrastructure, resulting in reduced cash. Cash & marketable securities were $64.0 billion at the end of 2Q23\. Cash & marketable securities were $70.0 billion at the end of 2022, $96.1 billion at the end of 2021, $84.4 billion at year-end 2020, and $55.0 billion at the end of 2019.

Total debt was $63.1 billion at the end of 1Q23\. Total debt was $67.2 billion at the end of 2022, $48.7 billion at the end of 2021, $31.8 billion at year-end 2020, and $23.4 billion at the end of 2019.

Net debt was $2.88 billion at year-end 2022\. Net cash was $47.3 billion at year-end 2021, $52.6 billion at year-end 2020, $31.6 billion at the end of 2019, and $17.6 billion at year-end 2018.

Amazon generates significant cash. Cash flow from operations was $46.7 billion in 2022, $46.3 billion in 2021, $66.1 billion in 2020, $38.5 billion in 2019, and $30.7 billion in 2018 Amazon's free cash flow was $5.5 billion for 2022, recovering from a use of $9 billion in 2021\. Free cash flow was $35.0 billion in 2020, $21.7 billion in 2019, $17.6 billion in 2018, and $6.4 billion in 2017\. Amazon has set a long-term goal of optimizing free cash flow.

The credit agencies rate Amazon's debt as investment grade. There is a substantial difference in agency ratings between the Baa1 at Moody's and the very strong AA- at S&P. Both agencies have stable outlooks.

Amazon does not pay and is unlikely to implement a dividend. The company previously repurchased shares mainly to offset dilution.

## Management & Risks

In July 2021, Founder Jeff Bezos transitioned to executive chairman, and former AWS leader Andy Jassy became the company's CEO. Brian Olsavsky is the CFO, and Jeffrey Wilke is the chief executive officer of the Worldwide Consumer business. In March 2021, Adam Selipsky was named the new CEO of Amazon Web Services.

Prior to leading AWS, Mr. Jassy was instrumental in developing the business. He played a key role in the development of cloud computing, infrastructure-as-a-service, and other elements of the cloud that we now take for granted. We believe he is the logical successor to Mr. Bezos.

Amazon, as a provider of online goods and services, may be better positioned than brick & mortar rivals during the crisis, but is not immune to challenges including lower consumer spending in a potential recessionary environment. We believe that Amazon has the strength to sustain growth during this difficult time, and its plans to add employees signal management's confidence in its long-term operating model and strategy.

The addition of Whole Foods positions Amazon in a low-margin business. Amazon has extensive experience in operating efficiently in the low-margin online retail industry. We expect the company to pursue margin expansion at WFM, not from conservative pricing (AMZN is already aggressively pricing WFM goods), but through increased efficiency and leverage from customer growth.

We give management high marks for continually making Amazon's 'store' cheaper, easier and more secure for shoppers. We think the security and convenience of Amazon's site has given many former critics of e-commerce the confidence to shop online. In addition, innovations like Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services, and Kindle have made Amazon an internet powerhouse. Amazon is likely to face fierce competition over the next several years as more companies expand online sales and match Amazon's prices offline. Amazon has been able to stay in front of physical and online retail rivals with innovations such as Prime, along with expanded third-party sales.

The company could be hurt in the event of a significant security breach, theft of client information, or outages at its Amazon Web Services unit. This is a risk for all e-commerce businesses, but may be heightened in the case of a well-known consumer company like Amazon.

## Company Description

Amazon.com is the leading U.S. e-commerce retailer and among the top e-commerce sites globally. Amazon.com also provides Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the global leader in cloud-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platforms. The company's Prime membership platform is a key online retail differentiator, providing customers with free shipping (after an annual fee) along with exclusive media content (music, video, audible books, etc.). The company's Kindle reader and Alexa-based Echo and Dot digital voice assistants are category leaders.

## Valuation

While the growth engine at Amazon is unmatched, the stock has been difficult to analyze from a valuation perspective. Given recent weakness in the stock, forward-looking (DFCF) valuations and price-based comparable valuations are increasingly attractive. AMZN trades at 57.5-times our 2023 GAAP EPS forecast and at 44.5-times our 2024 projection. The two-year forward P/E of 51.0 is below the trailing five-year multiple (2018-2022) of 72.6\. The relative P/E of 2.7 on our two-year average EPS forecast is below the historical relative P/E of 3.9\. Our historical comparables valuation is near $200 in a slight upward trend and above current levels.

AMZN trades at a two-year forward enterprise value/EBITDA multiple of 9.8 for FY23-24, a significant discount to its trailing five-year (2018-2022) multiple of 21.4\. We believe that AMZN merits a premium to historical EV/EBITDA given the company's growth in high-end offerings such as Prime and Prime Video; superior growth in AWS, digital advertising and subscription services; and unmatched volume and vendor leverage. On peer analysis, AMZN appears fairly valued near current prices. Using our two- and three-stage discounted free cash flow model, we calculate a value in the $220 range, down from a peak near $280, but still above current prices. Based on our historical comparables analysis, peer indicated value and discounted free cash flow valuation, our blended valuation model is about $210, above current prices and in a now-rising trend after declining. Appreciation to our 12-month target price of $165 implies a risk-adjusted return that is greater than our forecast for the broad market and thus consistent with a BUY rating.

Given the company's indisputable franchise leadership, ability to leverage its vendor relationships in the retail space, and market dominance and superior growth in infrastructure-as-a-service, we believe that AMZN warrants long-term accumulation in most equity accounts. We recommending initiating new positions or dollar-averaging into existing positions on recent weakness. On August 4 at midday, BUY-rated AMZN traded at $142.97, up $14.06.`;
